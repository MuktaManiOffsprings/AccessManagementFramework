Every software system has access management implemented to control the accessibitity of functionalities by different users. This implementation of access management is repeated for every software project or product being developed. 
We have a concept to create a generic software framework for Access Management which can be used as a base for developing different software systems and utilized for access management.

Just make a note of this and we will ask you questions and seek help to put toogether a functional specification document for the system. We will also feed you with more information for your understanding and using the same with your expertise to help us out write a professional, percise and easy to understand functional specification document.

1. Any software system can be configured either as a stand alone system or a SaaS system.
2. A sotware system consists of different modules. Each Module in the software system encompases a certain set of functionality. In the proposed Access Manament Framework each Module will be defined as an Entity
3. Each Functionality within the Module whose accessibility should be controlled is considered as an "Action"
4. That is in software system there will be modules and for each module there will be actions
5. The concept of "Application" in this systm is a logical group of Modules and there Actions. For example 
let's say there are 3 Modules. 
Employee Management Module which has Add, Update, View and Delete as actions
Invoicing Module which has Add, Update, View, Print actions 
Leave Management Module which has Create, Submit, Approve, Reject actions

These Modules and actions can be bundled as two different Applications
Application 1 is HR Application which will have 
Employee Management Module with all actions
Leave Management Module with all actions
Application 2 is Accounts Application which will have 
Employee Management Module with Only View Action 
Invoicing Module with all actions.

A Member is the Subscriber of the System.
IN stand alone mode there must be only one Member 
In SaaS mode there can be any number of Members
A Meber will have users in it. A member can have one or many users using the system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In SaaS mode a Member can subscribe to to one or more applications in the System.
The different functionalities of an applications can be bundled into diffent "Application Packages".
A Member can opt to subscribe to a specific Application package based on its need. 
So "Application Package" is esentially a subset of all the Module Actions of an Application with a given Name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Packages from different Applications (Only one per Application) can be bundled into "Application Package Group"

"Application Package Group" will allow a Member to Subscribe to differnt applications as one package as per their need.

Members always subscibe to "Application Package Groups" not individual "Application Package", so when an "Application Package" is created, the system automatically creates a corresponding "Application Package Group" containing only that "Application Package"

A  member is the subscriber of the system.
It can have one or more roles.
A role is accompaned with one or more actions.

A role consists of one or more actions.
A rolegroup is created with one or more roles.

A workspaceType is a structural arrangement of different task in a system.
A workspace is an acctual working area under a workspace type.
A workspaceType can consist of one or more workspaces.
One member can have one or more workspaceTypes.

The concept of "User-Workspace-Role" in this system is a logical group of modules like user, workspace, and role.
For example, A user can work in a zonal office 1(Workspace) as an accountant (Role).
