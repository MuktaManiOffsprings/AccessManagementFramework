Every software system has access management implemented to control the accessibitity of functionalities by different users. This implementation of access management is repeated for every software project or product being developed. 
We have a concept to create a generic software framework for Access Management which can be used as a base for developing different software systems and utilized for access management.

Just make a note of this and we will ask you questions and seek help to put together a functional specification document for the system. We will also feed you with more information for your understanding and using the same with your expertise to help us out write a professional, percise and easy to understand functional specification document.

1. Any software system can be configured either as a stand alone system or a SaaS system.
2. A sotware system consists of different modules. Each Module in the software system encompases a certain set of functionality. In the proposed Access Management Framework each Module will be defined as an Entity
3. Each Functionality within the Module whose accessibility should be controlled is considered as an "Action"
4. That is in software system there will be modules and for each module there will be actions
5. The concept of "Application" in this systm is a logical group of Modules and there Actions. For example 
let's say there are 3 Modules. 
Employee Management Module which has Add, Update, View and Delete as actions
Invoicing Module which has Add, Update, View, Print actions 
Leave Management Module which has Create, Submit, Approve, Reject actions
     
These Modules and actions can be bundled as two different Applications
Application 1 is HR Application which will have 
Employee Management Module with all actions
Leave Management Module with all action
Application 2 is Accounts Application which will have 
Employee Management Module with Only View Action 
Invoicing Module with all actions.

A Member is the Subscriber of the System.
IN stand alone mode there must be only one Member 
In SaaS mode there can be any number of Members
A Member will have users in it. A member can have one or many users using the system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In SaaS mode a Member can subscribe to to one or more applications in the System.
The different functionalities of an applications can be bundled into diffent "Application Packages".
A Member can opt to subscribe to a specific Application package based on its need. 
So "Application Package" is esentially a subset of all the Module Actions of an Application with a given Name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Packages from different Applications (Only one per Application) can be bundled into "Application Package Group"

"Application Package Group" will allow a Member to Subscribe to differnt applications as one package as per their need.

Members always subscibe to "Application Package Groups" not individual "Application Package", so when an "Application Package" is created, the system automatically creates a corresponding "Application Package Group" containing only that "Application Package"

A user is the entity who accesses the system.
A Member can have one or more users. A Member user is automatically created with the creation of a Member.

A Role is a group of logically related actions based on the organizational access distribution to its users.
The Role provides an easy and consistent way of managing access to different set of users to carry out same set of responsibilities assigned to them. 

Roles are defined at the Member level.

A workspaceType is structural division of working area of an organization.
Meber Workspace Type is the Root Workspace Type for all members. There is always one and only one RoootWorksapce for each Member. The RootWorkspace (Member Workspace) is authomatically created along with a Member.
A Organization can be divided into head office, branch, and zonal office.
A workspace is the actual instance of a Workspace Type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An user can have access to one or more workspaces.
In each workspace the user is assigned roles. The roles of a use can vary from workspace to workspace.
An user's accesse in different workspaces can be different based on the roles the user has in that specific workspace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A role group bundles a set of roles to enable assignment of those roles at once to a user based on his responsibilities/designation in the workspace.
Role Group are only used for convenience of assignment of multiple roles to a user at once in a given workspace. It is not set as a reference to the user in the workspace.
